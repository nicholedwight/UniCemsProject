					<h2>Planning and Resources</h2>
					<h3>Planning</h3>
					<h4>Flash Layout</h4>
						<p>This is the wireframe I made for a basis of the layout of the Flash scenario for the island views and audio and video I had chosen to take with me</p>
						<img src="img/islandplanning.jpg" alt="Flash Island Planning">
						<p>When I was putting together the Flash scenario, the layout changed slightly, but that's always to be expected, it's just progress.</p>
						<p>I really didn't have too much experience with Flash or ActionScript before this assignment so I spent a lot of time googling for how to do things, i.e. link buttons to previous pages, which was more complicated than expected, I found I had to link back to the first frame and then to whatever page the button really needed. This can be seen below</p>
						<p>BackIcon.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, function(me:MouseEvent):void{<br>
						  goToFrame(me, 1); <br>
						  goToFrame(me, 50) //Added second stop to prevent bug where videos would only play after going to Frame 1<br>
						  });</p>
						<p>Not only did this fix prevent the videos from not playing after I'd already clicked on one, since I had to go back to the video page, then click on another. There was another issue where my Back button on the Cello information page didn't link to anywhere! Adding in this bit of code and making sure the button physically appeared on frame 1 and frame 30(where it intended to go) fixed the issue.</p>
					<h4>3D Modelling</h4>
						<p>The majority of planning was on the 3D Island itself. I had tried about 3 or 4 different island terrain scenarios before settling on the final, which can be seen below, I kept wanting to put a volcanoe into it, but it seemed very unnecessary, given it wasn't listed in the brief. I spent the majority of my time in Mudbox and Zbrush creating the models to put on the terrain, the pet, trees, and cabin. The SOS rocks were made in Mudbox when the terrain was created.</p>
						<img src="img/island1.png" alt="first island"><p>This is the first island terrain I tried, but once I started adding the trees, cabin, and ocean, I decided to change it.</p>
						<img src="img/island2.png" alt="second island"><p>This is where I kept trying to add in a volcanoe, it never looked good because I didn't have the time or patience to add in the cliff detail it required. So the idea was tossed.</p>
						<img src="img/island3.png" alt="Final island"><p>This is the terrain for the final island layout, complete with the cabin and dragon import from Zbrush, I hoped that importing them into Mudbox first, instead of Maya would reduce the reflectiveness, but it didn't. I also changed the painting of the grass texture. It looked really fake in the previous island layout ideas. Instead I grabbed some textures off CG Textures and paid more attention to detail, adding in some moss and leafs around the cabin. Also there's a coral texture in the cove, and two different sand textures along the beaches. The airstrip texture was just some gravel and I painted the white on by hand. All that was left was to add the ocean, sky, trees, and camera/instrument.</p>
						<p>The biggest issue was when I would transfer the dragon model from Zbrush to Maya via GOZ, the render would be very reflective(this also happened to an extent with my cabin model), there wasn't enough time to find out why this happened or render it in another application and transfer it, so I provided the render from Zbrush for the pet slide in the Flash scenario, that way the detail and proper material can be seen. Below is a test render of the dragon in Maya with mental ray(rendering a Zbrush model in Maya Software crashes my computer), the reflectiveness is very visible. The model also appeared to have 'cracked' when I created the displacement and texture maps in Zbrush to transfer it over.</p>
						<img src="img/dragonrender.png" alt="Reflective Example of Dragon">
						<p>This just proves that there's plenty of room for me to grow when it comes to 3D modelling.</p>
					<h4>Audio Editing</h4>
						<p>For the audio editing in Premiere Pro, I learned how to do a fade in/out using the keyframes on the audio clip itself so the clips wouldn't feel so choppy.</p>
					<h4>Video Editing</h4>
						<p>I didn't have any issues with the video editing, since the Premiere Pro project we did earlier in the module taught me everything I needed to know.</p>

						<h1>About Me</h1>
						<img src="img/spinme.png" class="spin_me">
						<p>
							Nichole is an American expat, more precisely, hailing from Nebraska before later moving to Georgia, and has managed to cross the Atlantic to escape the sweltering clutches of the southern states. While she has acclimatised to Britain extremely well, her work still has a certain American touch. This doesn't mean there are bald eagles and stars 'n' stripes plastered all across her work, but there's undeniably that gregarious yet professional flair embedded in everything she touches-like an American Midas.</p>
						<p>
She is a polyglot both with human and programming languages, Nichole speaks English, German, and a tiny bit of Italian and Norwegian; as well as Python, Ruby, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, although she would definitely bring Python to a keyboard shootout. Studying Digital Media in her quest to be a true multimedia hybrid, she also has a new-found adoration of 3D-modelling and visual design.</p>
						<p>
When not doing any of the above, she can be found around a table trying her very hardest at board games, looking at cat pictures on the internet, passionately arguing why Matt Smith is by far the best Doctor, or winding down with a video game or five.
